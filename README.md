# Analysing the episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S
In the repository, I analyse all the episodes from the popular TV show Friends. I look mainly at sentiment analysis, and try to draw correlations with viewership, ratings and other parameters.

The first step of any project is to collect data from a potential source. The data for this project was collected from https://fangj.github.io/friends/
Although it was well organised, it required a fair bit of cleaning up. The jupyter notebook for data extraction can be found here.
